- 👋 Hi, I’m @Archietheowl
- 👀 I’m interested in accessability, inclusion, edTech, personal developement, learning new skills (especially in relation to software developement). 
- 🌱 I'm currently developing my skills with MySQL and the Flask framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment. Just getting used to gitHub for version control and keeping track of my own projects.
